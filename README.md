# Obsidian Mnemosyne Plugin

This plugin brings the concept of a Mnemosyne session.

- What is a Mnemosyne Session? (Another stupid abstract term?(yes))
  - A set of notes.

### How do I use this?
0. Install it: clone this thing in your vault location under .obsidian/plugins. Make sure community plugins are enabled. (This step might be unecesssary if I stop being lazy and put it on the market).
1. Go to the settings and define tags/paths that you want or don't want. Recomend not messing with this until you run the thing to get an idea of what's going on.
2. Start session calling the "Start Mnemosyne session" command: Which just creates the set of all the notes in the vault, it will then use the stuff set on the settings to filter it out.
3. Call the "Get next note" command. This will open a random note from the set. Do your edits/review on the note that you want do.
4. Repeat step 3 until the set is empty.

That's it, use it how you like. Tune the filters for your workflow.

TODO:
- Fix skip
- Check the filters are working
- Make pretty? (lazy)
